## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, you may either:

- create a GitHub issue on this repository; or
- join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Xu8453VBAv) and create a new forum ticket in **#support-forum**.

We aim to be as transparent as possible; if a vulnerability is found, it is most likely to be disclosed publicly through the Discord as well as a security
advisory on our website.
