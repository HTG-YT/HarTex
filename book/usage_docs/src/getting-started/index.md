Hello! Thank you for checking out HarTex.

This series of documentation will go through the things you need to get started with HarTex. This page will act as a
central check-in point to direct you to various parts of this documentation depending on your existing skill set among
other things.

## I don't have the bot yet!

No problem! You may check out the [What is HarTex?](/HarTex-rust-discord-bot/docs/usage/general-info/what-is-hartex) section for some basic information
about what the bot can do.

In order to gain access and begin to use the bot, you will need to submit a Whitelist Application, for your Discord
guild, first. The current minimum whitelist requirements and criteria can be found in the *TBA* channel of our support
guild.

If you attempt to invite the bot to a guild and that the guild has not been whitelisted yet, the bot will automatically
leave the guild and send a message to the guild owner about the fact and how to get his or her guild whitelisted. It is
not recommended to keep inviting the bot after it leaves your guild.

## I have been whitelisted! What do I do now?

Now you can invite the bot by using this *TBA*. More information on how you can set up the bot can be found at
[Setting Up HarTex](/HarTex-rust-discord-bot/docs/usage/general-info/setting-up-hartex).

## I have the bot now. How do I set it up?

Thank you for choosing HarTex! Now you may head to [Setting Up HarTex](/HarTex-rust-discord-bot/docs/usage/general-info/setting-up-hartex)
and start from there.
