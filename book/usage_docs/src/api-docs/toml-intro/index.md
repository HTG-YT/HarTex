# Introduction to TOML

HarTex uses a markup language called "TOML" for its configuration.

TOML aims to be a minimal configuration file format that's easy to read due to obvious semantics. TOML is designed to 
map unambiguously to a hash table. TOML should be easy to parse into data structures in a wide variety of languages.

This documentation assumes that you have previous experience with TOML. You may look at some more examples of TOML
syntax to familiarize yourself with TOML, if you do not have much experience with it yet.
