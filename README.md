**HarTex: Discord Server Management. Reimagined.**

HarTex is a Discord bot for server administration and moderation; designed to be robust and with unparalleled flexibility to cater for various needs of different Discord servers.

This is the main source code repository for HarTex. It contains various components of HarTex: its API backend, Bors buildbot, buildsystem, Discord frontend, localization infrastructure, utilities and the Web frontend.

## Getting Started

The simplest way to use HarTex is to use the publicly hosted instance of it. We are currently working towards a publicly hosted instance, so please stay around in case there are any updates!

Announcements will be made as we progress through finishing the basic functionality of the bot and approaching public testing.

## Self-hosting

If you are interested in using HarTex at an early stage, then you may host your own instance of HarTex. Documentation for
which will be added at a later date.

## Community

We have a dedicated [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Xu8453VBAv)! The Discord server is primarily about Team HaTex, but we also provide support for HarTex as well as answering questions. Feel free to join us!
