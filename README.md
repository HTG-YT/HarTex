We have a dedicated [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Xu8453VBAv)! If you have any questions or ideas, or is it the case that you want to express your thoughts, you're welcome to join the server!

## Getting Started

The simplest way to use HarTex is to use the publicly hosted instance of it. We are currently working towards a publicly hosted instance, so please stay around in case there are any updates!

Announcements will be made as we progress through finishing the basic functionality of the bot and approaching public testing.

## Building, Testing and Self-hosting

> [!WARNING]
> **While we do support development of the project on Windows, please make sure that all files are configured to use the LF line ending.**
> **The Windows CRLF line ending does not work well with the testsuite.**

If you are interested in using HarTex at an early stage, then you may host your own instance of HarTex. Documentation for
which will be added at a later date.
