In light of the rapid development of HarTex (June 2023 at the time of writing), HarTex is currently only for **internal usage** at the [Team HarTex Discord](discord.gg/Xu8453VBAv).
<br>
<br>
We are planning to launch a **Nightly Testing Programme** for a small group of users to test drive HarTex as it is in the progress of being developed. More
<br>
updates will be posted as we progress through the development of HarTex; alongside with things regarding the programme.
